 SleepWell Mattresses
 “The Mattress Revolution for Better Sleep”




### **2. Problem**

 Over 70% of adults report having sleep issues, with poor sleep linked to health problems like obesity, heart disease, and mental health disorders.
 Many people still sleep on old, uncomfortable mattresses that negatively affect their health, leading to poor sleep quality and discomfort.
 Despite the availability of mattress options, there’s a lack of affordable, high-quality mattresses that meet both comfort and health needs.


### **3. Solution**

 SleepWell offers an innovative mattress design, combining advanced materials (memory foam, cooling gel, hybrid technology) to provide optimal comfort and support.
 Our mattresses are designed to improve sleep quality, reduce pain, and enhance recovery through scientifically backed ergonomic features.
Offering a high-quality product at an accessible price point, SleepWell bridges the gap between premium mattresses and affordability.



### **4. Market Opportunity**
 The global mattress market is expected to exceed \$40 billion by 2025, with strong growth driven by the increasing awareness of the importance of quality sleep.
 Health-conscious consumers, young professionals, aging population, and people experiencing sleep issues or chronic pain.
 The U.S. mattress market alone is projected to reach \$20 billion by 2025, with online sales accounting for a significant share of the market.
